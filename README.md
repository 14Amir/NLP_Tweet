# NLP_Tweet
a NLP project for classifying tweets using Distil Bert  
In this project, we want to evaluate some tweets and classify them as hate or not hate. First, we
preprocess and then tokenize it with the special tokenizer of our model. when the data has been
prepared, we use the main model. The pre-trained model in this project is DistilBERT. After all,
we evaluate the model on the test set using different metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, f1
score, and confusion matrix
